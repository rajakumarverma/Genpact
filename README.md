# Power BI Project For Genpact

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Power BI project that I have developed using dummy data. Power BI is a powerful business intelligence tool that allows you to create interactive and insightful data visualizations. In this project, I have utilized Power BI to analyze and visualize data from a sample dataset, providing meaningful insights and a user-friendly interface to explore the data.

## Project Files

The repository includes the following key files and folders:

- `PowerBI_Project.pbix`: This is the main Power BI report file that contains all the data connections, data transformations, visualizations, and dashboards. You can open and interact with this file using Power BI Desktop.

- `Data/`: This folder contains the dataset used in the project. The data source files are typically in Excel, CSV, or other supported formats. In this project, the data has been anonymized and is used solely for demonstration purposes.

- `Images/`: This folder includes images, screenshots, or other visual assets that are used in the Power BI report or for documentation purposes.
